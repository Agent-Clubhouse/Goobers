# The stage contract (V0)

A **stage** (this doc's "stage" is the workflow/task types' "task" — the terms
are equivalent, ARCHITECTURE.md §5) is a unit the runner executes: a
deterministic command or an agentic harness invocation. Gates are a machine
state whose evaluators run with stage-execution semantics.

Three JSON envelopes carry everything, defined in Go (`api/v1alpha1/envelope.go`,
`artifact.go`) and mirrored by closed JSON Schemas (`api/schemas/*.schema.json`):

| Envelope | Schema | Direction |
|---|---|---|
| `InvocationEnvelope` | `invocation.schema.json` | runner → stage |
| `ResultEnvelope` | `result.schema.json` | stage → runner |
| `Verdict` | `verdict.schema.json` | gate evaluator → runner |
| `ArtifactPointer` | `artifact-pointer.schema.json` | shared; how stages exchange bytes |

## The load-bearing invariant

**No stage reaches into another stage's state** (§2.4). Stages exchange
**envelopes and artifact pointers only**. This is enforced *by construction*, not
by convention:

- The invocation envelope has **no field carrying an upstream stage's result
  body**. A stage consumes prior work only through `contextPointers` — read-only
  pointers into the run journal. (`envelope_test.go` fails the build if a
  `ResultEnvelope`-typed field is ever added to the invocation.)
- The schemas are **closed** (`additionalProperties: false`): an envelope
  carrying an undeclared field — e.g. a legacy `upstreamOutputs` — is a
  validation error (`testdata/envelopes/invalid/invocation-upstream-reachthrough.json`).
- `outputs` on the result envelope accepts **scalars only**; anything larger is
  an artifact, referenced by pointer. State cannot be smuggled through `outputs`.

## How a stage gets its input

The runner hands the stage an `InvocationEnvelope`:

- `goal` — what to achieve.
- `workspace` — absolute path to the fresh, isolated, disposable workspace the
  stage runs in. Repo-backed stages receive a git worktree at tiers 1–2; a
  deterministic task with `run.workspace: scratch` receives an empty directory
  and does not resolve a repository.
- `contextPointers[]` — the read-only inputs. Each is exactly one of:
  - an `artifact` (`ArtifactPointer`: journal-relative `path` + `sha256` digest) —
    upstream outputs and input snapshots; or
  - an `external` ref (`kind` + `uri`) — e.g. the issue/PR URL. Content outside the
    journal is untrusted; fetching and trusting it is the stage's job.
  - on a **repass**, also the gate's most-recent `Verdict` artifact — see
    "Repass context obligation" below.
- `capabilities[]` — the capability grants the stage's definition declares (e.g.
  `github:issues:write`). **Capability admission fails closed**: credentials for a
  capability not listed here are never materialized (§5).
- `inputs` — the stage's own static config from its definition.
- `item`, `repoRef`, `limits` — the triggering backlog item, target repo, and
  execution bounds.

## Where a stage writes its output

The stage returns a `ResultEnvelope`:

- `status` — one of `success`, `failure`, `blocked`.
- `artifacts[]` — its produced outputs. The stage writes bytes into the run
  journal (`api/v1alpha1.WriteArtifact`) and returns an `ArtifactPointer` for
  each. Downstream stages receive these as `contextPointers`.
- `outputs` — small declared **scalar** values only.
- `error` — structured failure detail (`code`, `message`, `retryable`); **required
  when `status == failure`**.
- `summary`, `metrics` — human and telemetry detail.

Every stage process also receives `GOOBERS_TELEMETRY_DIR`, a writable directory
scoped to that stage attempt. A stage may append one JSON object per line to:

- `metrics.jsonl`: `{"name":"items","value":42,"unit":"count","attrs":{"source":"scan"}}`
- `events.jsonl`: `{"ts":"2026-07-18T18:00:00Z","name":"scan.complete","attrs":{"files":42}}`

The runner ingests both files when the stage exits. Emitted metrics are merged
into `ResultEnvelope.metrics` without replacing executor-computed values; metrics
and events are attached to the stage span and flow through the journal rollup.
Agentic reviewer gates receive the same emission surface on their gate span.
Each `attrs` object may contain at most 125 entries. Malformed or oversized
lines are counted and dropped without changing the stage or gate outcome.

## Artifact passing (the A → B hand-off)

Non-scalar data moves **only** by pointer:

1. Stage A: `ptr, _ := v1alpha1.WriteArtifact(journalRoot, "artifacts/a/out.txt", data, "text/plain")`
   → returns a pointer whose `digest` commits to the exact bytes.
2. Runner: puts `ptr` into stage B's invocation as a `contextPointer`. B never sees
   A's `ResultEnvelope`.
3. Stage B: `bytes, err := ptr.Resolve(journalRoot)` — reads the artifact
   **read-only** and **verifies the digest**; a mismatch is `ErrDigestMismatch`.
   Paths that escape the journal root (absolute or `..`) are refused
   (`ErrPathEscape`). Redaction runs journal-side before digesting, so digests
   commit to scrubbed bytes (§4).

See `artifact_test.go:TestTwoStagePipelineByPointerOnly` for the end-to-end toy
pipeline.

## What the runner does on each status

| Status | Runner action |
|---|---|
| `success` | advance the state machine to the next stage/gate |
| `failure` | **Non-retryable escalate disposition first (#415):** if `error.retryable == false` **and** `error.code` is a recognized escalate code (`ISSUE_OVER_SCOPE` / `NEEDS_DECOMPOSITION`), bypass the `Next` gate's evaluator and route through its optional `escalate` control branch; without one, terminate directly at `@escalate`. Otherwise: if `Next` is a gate, advance — the gate branches on the failure (the reviewer-gate pattern); if not (a non-gate stage, terminal, or empty `Next`), the run ends `PhaseFailed`. Never run downstream stages on a failed result, never silently complete. |
| `blocked` | **finish the run `escalated`** (#544/#545) — never a pause. The blocked cause is journaled (`blocked_by_agent`, carrying `error`), the claim is released via the normal terminal path, and the driving issue is notified: if `outputs.blockedBy` names blocking issue numbers, backlog selection records the block and skips the issue until every named blocker closes (self-heals automatically, #552); otherwise the issue is parked `goobers:needs-human` (#539's convention) since there is nothing concrete for selection to key off. |

`Task.Retry` (declared retry policy, attempt budget, backoff) governs only
**dispatch/infra errors** — a Go error returned by the executor, not a
business `failure`/`blocked` `ResultEnvelope`. Each policy-driven retry
attempt is a new journal entry, never overwritten history (§5). A business
`failure`/`blocked` result is never retried by `Task.Retry`; it is handled
per the table above.

**Agentic session timeout & `Task.OnTimeout` (#724).** An agentic stage's
harness session is bounded by a wall-clock timeout (currently a flat 30m,
`internal/harness.DefaultTimeout`; not yet per-stage configurable — #151 is
the natural home for a DSL-expressed limit). A timeout is a dispatch error
(marked `invoke.IsTimeout`), so by default it consumes `Task.Retry` budget
and, when exhausted, discards the run — historically throwing away real,
committed, in-progress work whose only unfinished step was CI verification.
`Task.OnTimeout` selects that behavior:

- `""` / `fail` (default) — discard the timed-out attempt and let `Task.Retry`
  run; fail the run once the budget is exhausted.
- `salvage` — on a session timeout, if the run branch carries a **viable
  committed diff** (`git diff base...HEAD` is non-empty), complete the stage
  with that diff and advance to `Next` (normally the reviewer gate, then the
  deterministic `local-ci` stage that owns `make ci`) instead of discarding
  the run. A pre-commit timeout (empty diff) has nothing to salvage and falls
  back to the `fail` path. Only valid on an **agentic** stage (the compiler
  rejects it on a deterministic one), whose deliverable is its committed diff.
  A salvaged completion records a `salvage-on-timeout.json` provenance marker
  and sets `outputs.salvagedOnTimeout = true`.

Salvage is the complement to bounding the implement session to *think-time*:
the implementer is instructed to run only fast, targeted verification and let
the deterministic `local-ci` stage own the full `-race` suite, so the session
should not spend its budget on test wall-clock in the first place — and if it
still times out mid-flight, the committed work is not lost.

For gates, the evaluator returns a `Verdict` (`decision` ∈ `pass` / `fail` /
`needs-changes`, plus `rationale`, `evidence[]` artifact pointers, and
`findings[]`); the gate maps the decision to a branch. A gate outcome with no
defined branch is an error, never a silent pass.

**Repass context obligation (#412).** When a gate's branch routes back to a
stage the run already dispatched (a repass — most commonly `needs-changes` →
`implement`), the runner attaches that gate's just-recorded `Verdict` as a
`contextPointer` on the repass invocation, named `<gate>.verdict`, via the
same pointer-only mechanism "Artifact passing" above describes for any other
upstream artifact — never the raw `ResultEnvelope`, never a schema change. A
repassing stage that reads the reviewer's actual rationale/findings can
address them directly, rather than re-inferring "something needs to change"
from the diff alone.

## Versioning & unknown-field policy

- The contract version is `v1alpha1` (`StageContractVersion`). The whole
  `api/v1alpha1` package + `api/schemas` set is that version.
- Schemas are **closed**: unknown fields are a validation error. This is
  deliberate — it is what makes reach-through impossible and keeps the seam tight.
- Additive or breaking changes bump the contract version rather than loosening a
  schema. Validate an envelope with `api/validate.(*Validator).ValidateEnvelope`.
